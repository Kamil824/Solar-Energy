        <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
        <h6>Welcome to the Solar Energy website. Here you will find some basic information regarding the source of energy that does not pollute the environment.</h6>

        <h3>"In a single hour, the amount of power from the sun that strikes the Earth is more than the entire world consumes in an year."</h3>
        <p>To put that in numbers, from Each hour 430 quintillion Joules of energy from the sun hits the Earth. That's 430 with 18 zeroes after it! In comparison, the total amount of energy that all humans use in a year is 410 quintillion Joules.</p>

            <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
            <p>Solar energy, radiation from the Sun capable of producing heat, generating electricity. The total amount of solar energy incident on Earth is vastly in excess of the worldâ€™s current and anticipated energy requirements. If suitably harnessed, this highly diffused source has the potential to satisfy all future energy needs. In the 21st century solar energy is expected to become increasingly attractive as a renewable energy source because of its inexhaustible supply and its nonpolluting character, in stark contrast to the finite fossil fuels coal, petroleum, and natural gas.</p>

            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
            <p>Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.

                Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial solar electric systems.</p>

            <h2>Battery Storage</h2>
            <p>What is battery storage?
                Battery storage technologies are essential to speeding up the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy. Battery storage systems will play an increasingly pivotal role between green energy supplies and responding to electricity demands.
                Battery storage, or battery energy storage systems (BESS), are devices that enable energy from renewables, like solar and wind, to be stored and then released when customers need power most. Lithium-ion batteries, which are used in mobile phones and electric cars, are currently the dominant storage technology</p>
